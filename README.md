         Agriculture plays a vital role in our daily life. Inorder to increase the yeild we have developed an Iot Based Smart farming system. This smart agriculture using IOT system is driven by Arduino,various sensors like temperature sensor, humidity sensors, water level sensors and Dc motors were used in this project. This system checks the humidity, moisture and water level of the crops. It also helps the farmers to remotely monitor their feild.
